# **Introduction**

This repo contains the analysis of Melbourne Australia’s listings data collected by Inside Airbnb to better understand the impact of Airbnb’s listings in neighborhoods and cities. The dataset for this project is the Melbourne Airbnb Analysis and it was obtained from the Kaggle dataset (http://insideairbnb.com/melbourne). This dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Melbourne which was compiled in 2019-2020. 

Using the data and working in Jupyter Notebook, we performed the required cleaning for the data, and conducted/created an exploratory analysis with supporting visualizations. The initial data review/cleaning and general exploratory analysis can be found in the file named “Data_Cleaning.ipynb.” Cleaned data was saved from this notebook into a file we named "data_clean_bnb.csv". This Python script processes Airbnb rental data and saves it as a GeoJSON file. It connects to an SQLite database, writes the data frame to a new table named "airbnb_clean", and then closes the database connection. The resulting data can be used for further analysis or visualization of Airbnb rental locations. The script requires the use of libraries such as Pandas, Geopandas, SQLite3, and Shapely.geometry, among others.
