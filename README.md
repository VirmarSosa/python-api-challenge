Part I - WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500 cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized simple Python library and OpenWeatherMap API

Part II - VacationPy

Now I used my skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. I used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.
